# Overview

DrugAuth is a decentralized application (DApp) that provides secure tracking of pharmaceutical drug batches through every stage of the supply chainâ€”from manufacturing to customer delivery. The system leverages Ethereum blockchain technology for immutable record keeping and IPFS for secure document storage, ensuring complete traceability and authenticity verification of pharmaceutical products.

The application addresses critical needs in pharmaceutical supply chains by providing tamper-proof records, complete traceability from manufacturer to end customer, secure document storage, role-based access control, and real-time drug authenticity verification via QR codes.

# System Architecture

## Full-Stack Architecture
The application follows a monolithic full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns. The main entry point is a Node.js/Express server that serves both API endpoints and the React frontend in production, while using Vite for development.

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ethers.js for Ethereum blockchain interactions and MetaMask wallet integration
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation for type-safe form management

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **API Design**: RESTful API with clear endpoint structure for drug batches, supply chain events, and verification
- **Storage Strategy**: Hybrid approach using in-memory storage for development and PostgreSQL for production

## Blockchain Layer
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts deployed on Ethereum Goerli testnet
- **Development Tools**: Hardhat for contract compilation, testing, and deployment
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimized contract settings with 200 runs for efficient deployment
- **Network Configuration**: Support for both local development (Hardhat network) and Goerli testnet

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with structured tables for drug batches, supply chain events, and user management
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schemas ensuring type safety across the application
- **Off-chain Storage**: IPFS via Web3.Storage for storing certificates and documents (free up to 5GB)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based session storage using connect-pg-simple

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Wallet-Based Authentication**: MetaMask wallet integration for user authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Five distinct roles (manufacturer, producer, distributor, pharmacist, customer) with appropriate permissions
- **Address Validation**: Ethereum address validation and verification throughout the application

## Key Features Implementation
- **Drug Registration**: Form-based interface for entering drug metadata with IPFS certificate upload
- **Ownership Tracking**: Smart contract-based transfer system maintaining complete audit trail
- **Verification System**: Batch ID-based drug lookup with full transaction history display
- **QR Code Generation**: Dynamic QR code creation for easy drug lifecycle tracking
- **Supply Chain Timeline**: Visual representation of drug journey through supply chain stages
